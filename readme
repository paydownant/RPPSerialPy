Easy serial connection between board running Linux based os such as RaspberryPi and controllers running micropython

Root directory contains the necessary algorithms to run subprocess and connection to the micropython board
    main.py contains example for led pwm control sending the values 0 to 255 over serial connection to mpboard

Controller directory should contain the files to run on micropython
